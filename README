# it has been tested with the gnu gfortran compiler and gnu toolchain
# to run with other compiler / toolchains , please refer to related manuals
# to compile all the examples on unix-like OS, type
./configure
# then type
make
#or
gmake
#to install
make install
#to compile only one of them, say circle.f, type
make circle
#to remove generated files type
make clean
#to remove ALL generated files, included Makefile (you have to run ./configure again, then)
make distclean
#to see the generated executable files
ls . bin
#to see all generated files
lsa *
#aka 
ls -alhrt *
#generated programs are in the current dir after make
#or inside bin after make install
