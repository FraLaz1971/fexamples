# this project contains simple fortran (f77) examples
# some of them inspired by exercises in the tutorial designed

# "Introduction to Fortran at Stanford University", 1996.

# it has been tested with the gnu gfortran compiler and gnu toolchain
# to run with other compiler / toolchains , please refer to related manuals
# there are included some f90 / f95 examples exercises
# inspired by the book written by Ian D. Chivers and Jane Sleightholme
# "Introduction to Programming with Fortran", 2006
#
# to compile all the f77 examples on unix-like OS, type
./configure
# then type
make
#or
gmake
#to install
make install
#to compile only one of them, say circle.f, type
make circle
# to use
./circle
#or when installed
bin/circle
#or
./while <<< 150
#to remove generated files type
make clean
#to remove ALL generated files, included Makefile (you have to run ./configure again, then)
make distclean
#to see the generated executable files
ls . bin
#to see all generated files
lsa *
#aka 
ls -alhrt *
#generated programs are in the current dir after make
#or inside bin after make install
#look also at
#src/README
# it's included a fortran90 example wages.f90
# it prints wages and taxation of employees
# computing from input data given interactively by the user
# to compile it with gfortran
gfortran src/wages.f90 -o wages
# to run
./wages
